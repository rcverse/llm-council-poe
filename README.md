# LLM Council

![llmcouncil](header.jpg)

This repository is a fork of the original LLM Council project. The goal of this fork is to keep the original experience intact while adding provider flexibility for this repo's users.

## What changed in this fork

- Added dual-provider support through a shared OpenAI-compatible client flow.
- Added provider selection via config/env (`openrouter` or `poe`).
- Kept backward compatibility for existing OpenRouter-only setups.
- Kept the original 3-stage council behavior and UI flow unchanged.

In a bit more detail, here is what happens when you submit a query:

1. **Stage 1: First opinions**. The user query is given to all LLMs individually, and the responses are collected. The individual responses are shown in a "tab view", so that the user can inspect them all one by one.
2. **Stage 2: Review**. Each individual LLM is given the responses of the other LLMs. Under the hood, the LLM identities are anonymized so that the LLM can't play favorites when judging their outputs. The LLM is asked to rank them in accuracy and insight.
3. **Stage 3: Final response**. The designated Chairman of the LLM Council takes all of the model's responses and compiles them into a single final answer that is presented to the user.

## Vibe Code Alert

This project was 99% vibe coded as a fun Saturday hack because I wanted to explore and evaluate a number of LLMs side by side in the process of [reading books together with LLMs](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1990577951671509438). It's nice and useful to see multiple responses side by side, and also the cross-opinions of all LLMs on each other's outputs. I'm not going to support it in any way, it's provided here as is for other people's inspiration and I don't intend to improve it. Code is ephemeral now and libraries are over, ask your LLM to change it in whatever way you like.

## Setup (fork-specific notes)

### 1. Install Dependencies

The project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for project management.

**Backend:**
```bash
uv sync
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 2. Configure Provider + API Credentials

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Choose provider: "openrouter" (default) or "poe"
LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter

# Optional generic credentials (works for both providers)
# LLM_API_KEY=...
# LLM_API_URL=https://.../v1/chat/completions

# Backward-compatible OpenRouter setup
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...

# Optional provider-specific Poe key (used when LLM_PROVIDER=poe and LLM_API_KEY is unset)
# POE_API_KEY=...
```

Provider details:
- OpenRouter API key: [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)
- Poe can be used via an OpenAI-compatible endpoint and key by setting `LLM_PROVIDER=poe` and `LLM_API_KEY` (or `POE_API_KEY`).

Migration note:
- Existing setups with only `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` continue to work (default provider is OpenRouter).

### 3. Configure Models (Optional)

Edit `backend/config.py` to customize the council:

```python
COUNCIL_MODELS = [
    "openai/gpt-5.1",
    "google/gemini-3-pro-preview",
    "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5",
    "x-ai/grok-4",
]

CHAIRMAN_MODEL = "google/gemini-3-pro-preview"
```

## Running the Application

**Option 1: Use the start script**
```bash
./start.sh
```

**Option 2: Run manually**

Terminal 1 (Backend):
```bash
uv run python -m backend.main
```

Terminal 2 (Frontend):
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.10+), async httpx, OpenAI-compatible provider client (OpenRouter/Poe)
- **Frontend:** React + Vite, react-markdown for rendering
- **Storage:** JSON files in `data/conversations/`
- **Package Management:** uv for Python, npm for JavaScript
